                    <p className="text-xl mt-20">Always seeking, taking on, and executing difficult tasks has allowed me to develop a fairly eclectic background. After attaining my Master's Degree in English Literature, I jumped into teaching as an adjunct instructor at a couple of Universities in San Antonio. My time spent in the classroom was well-received, but as I was teaching I decided to take on another challenge--studying for and earning my Airframe and Powerplant Licenses. The Aviation world lead me to a couple of different places, from working as an aircraft technician on 737s, to General Aviation, to managing an Aircraft Repair Station in Boerne, Texas. The Aviation world is full of its own challenges, which is perhaps what brought about my next endeavor--software development.

                    <p className="text-xl">From one difficult and technical arena to another, I took it upon myself to jump into programming and explore the boundaries of code. With countless technologies available to explore, there is no shortage of new things to learn...and that doesn't scare me, it excites me. Of all the things my diverse background has taught me, focus, comminucation, and determination have driven me to the top of each mountain I set out to climb.</p>
